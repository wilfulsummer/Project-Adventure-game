# .cursorrules File - What is this?

## Purpose
This `.cursorrules` file contains development guidelines and rules for the Adventure Game project. It's specifically designed for use with **Cursor AI** (an AI-powered code editor) to ensure consistent development practices.

## Why is it here?
- **AI Development**: This game was developed with the assistance of AI tools
- **Cursor Modders**: For other developers using Cursor AI, this file provides context and rules
- **Consistency**: Ensures all AI-assisted development follows the same patterns and guidelines
- **Quality Control**: Contains rules for testing, committing, and maintaining code quality

## What it contains
- **Code Style Guidelines**: Indentation, commenting, function design
- **Testing Rules**: How to test features without breaking the game
- **Commit Message Standards**: Professional commit message formatting
- **Git Rules**: How to handle .gitignore and save files
- **Game Mechanics**: Important game system details for developers

## For Cursor AI Users
If you're using Cursor AI to work on this project:
1. **Read this file first** to understand the development rules
2. **Follow the guidelines** when asking AI to modify code
3. **Use the testing rules** to ensure changes work correctly
4. **Follow commit message standards** for clean version control

## For Traditional Developers
Even if you're not using Cursor AI, this file serves as:
- **Development documentation**
- **Code quality standards**
- **Testing procedures**
- **Project guidelines**

## Note
This file is **intentionally committed** to the repository so all developers (AI-assisted or not) can access the same development rules and maintain consistency across the project.
